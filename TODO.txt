~ write unit tests for all chain functions, pass and fail, build only in TEST mode
* refactor chain/link to not use empty origin node
* verify all tests still pass
* move all function pointers into chain typedef and make static
  initialized from factory function
X pass in link dtor function to delete and destroy, do not cache
* refactor into pimpl private data pattern
* fix chain_join
- MUST migrate unit tests to a different framework
    - still must be lightweight, supportable by embedded targets.
    - must support multiple test*.c files, from one main is OK
- app: migrate over to sink project and refactor
- introduce bytes object as managed string / byte array
- fix mem zero optimization problem (volatile?)
- add license target to makefile to update all src
- adjust makefile for so, a lib targets
- migrate selected useful librmf objects
- constify return values, pointers functions
