TODO:

(HIGH PRIORITY)

- BUG: console->print(console, "%s", "") seems to crash.
- introduce functional tests and split test make targets into func and unit
- implement 'bits_t' object with tests.
  - This will be needed for raytl to support arbitrary bit width architectures.
  - consider finally finishing C++ BitDeque in parallel.
    
- introduce some language constructs to scallop:
  - add while loop language construct
  - add if-else language construct
  - after these features are added and confirmed working, TAG it and USE it.
- clean up TODOs and FIXMEs in the code.

(LOWER PRIORITY)

- modularize command sets to dynamically loadable shared modules
  - eliminates compile-time dependency
  - start with builtins => basecmds.so?
  - must be loadable at least by command line option, implying
    separation of scallop from rayco, or at least scallop as a standalone
    ELF entry point.  all further derivative projects will be .so
- consider using doxygen to generate project documentation
- consider adding metadata tags to project once production-ready
- harden code with static and dynamic analysis (valgrind, others...)
- dumb down to 32bits for embedded systems that don't support 64 bit integers
  - port to cc65 and test in vice c64 emulator
- projects to be refactored and updated to use this library:
  - sink, particles, raytl, others?
  - migrate selected useful legacy librmf objects
- add license target to makefile to update all src
- constify return values, pointers functions wherever possible
- add install and uninstall phony targets
- refactor bytes_t interface to have _raw() versus plain, use bytes with plain.
- Option in blammo logger for newline style \r\n or \n
  - Maybe require escape/unescape functionality in bytes_t
  - else present as a simple 'universal newline / optional' option
- periodically scrape 'TODO's out of source and paste them here.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
DONE:

* introduce some language constructs to scallop:
  * recursive descent parser for expression evaluation (integer only - assume no FPU)
    * research "recursive descent parser" and "arithmetic expression evaluator"
* BUG: weird print corrupted string, how to reproduce?
  * raytl_debug > print ((true == true) && (x == y))
    ((true == true) && (x == y)) lp pr is 0
* verify all tests still pass
* move all function pointers into chain typedef and make static
  initialized from factory function
* refactor into pimpl private data pattern
* fix chain_join
* MUST migrate unit tests to a different framework
    * still must be lightweight, supportable by embedded targets.
    * must support multiple test*.c files, from one main is OK
* add PRNG library (for targets that don't have one already)
    * xoshiro / xoroshiro generators and the PRNG shootout http://prng.di.unimi.it/
* introduce bytes object as managed string / byte array
* adjust makefile for so, a lib targets
* consider returning int instead of void * for shellcmd handlers
* Implement help command
  * Need to figure out console/stdout thread protection
  * able to pass a FILE * around or need an object with locking?
* BUG: setting log file name always results in garbage file
* BUG alias bogus log, unalias log, help crashes!!!
  * logic is inverted - fix it twice!!
  (problem was original non-alias command was deleted, leaving
   invalid unmanaged pointer to subcmds in aliased cmd)
* need to introduce a thread-safe console
  * support input as well as output?  how to support linenoise?
* BUG: cannot unregister test alias, says it's immutable!!! 
* BUG: cannot unregister routines!!! says it's immutable!!!
* break out all builtin commands into scallblt.c/h or scallop_builtin
  * need to add console() public method, and use commands() instead of priv
  * only need to export one function and that is the register_builtins()
    and pass in the base command tree pointer.  all else can be static.
* finish bytes_t object calls read()/write() (others?) and complete unit tests
  * need a 'find' substring match returning offset & size.  left-to-right and vice versa
  * need a replace() function to replace at location,  also insert() and remove()
* consider other builtin commands: print, (dereference object???)
* need to introduce scallop procedures
  * these are distinct from scripts, and necessary for specific projects
  * will likely need to support variables, probably in string format
  * check if cc65 supports env put/get, make design decision
    * decision is to manage variables independently
  * need an 'alias' command to store routines as type definitions -- semantics
* Needed: bytes_t is needed for:
  * dynamic contextual prompt
  * appendable / formatted help report
  * routine names? / routine lines
  * dynamic reprint buffers in console
* Rework console->reprint()
  * use dynamically sized bytes_t
  * refactor how it works, writing substrings-at-once
* Enable command history, with options, when linenoise is available.
* console to borrow message type enum from blammo, but with it's own strings.
* fix mem zero optimization problem (volatile?)
  * see URL commend in utils.c
* refactor chain/link object
  * reconsidering circularity of linkage.
    * either terminate with NULL or add 'final', 'begin', or 'end' nodes.
  * start with a good iterator paradigm and let that drive the design.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
MOSTLY DONE / SUPERCEDED:

~ write unit tests for all chain functions, pass and fail, build only in TEST mode
X pass in link dtor function to delete and destroy, do not cache
  (This is now covered by notional collect_t
