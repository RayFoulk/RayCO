# RayTL
Goal: A Register-Transfer Level (RTL) circuit simulator framework similar to VHDL or Verilog, but purposefully simpler and much more limited in scope.

# Why?
Mainly because I want to.  I enjoy creating and using my own tools.
Also, VHDL and Verilog are both really a superset of what I need to accomplish my goals.

# Status
This project is purely vaporware at this point.  I need to lay out the design goals and formulate some hard requirements.
In my head, the conceptual design has flip-flopped between using C99 or C++.
I still ultimately don't know which way I'll go, but for now this repository
is serving (at least temporarly) as a placeholder for some utility code that I had planned to make use of in the project.
Honestly, it's entirely possible that this exercise may end in me simply commiting to learning Verilog.
