# RayCO
- Ray's C Objects
- A collection of C objects for general use in C/C++ projects
- Written in C99 by choice for environments where C++ is not available or preferred.

# Goals
- Fundamental design goal is to have as few dependencies as possible
- Produce objects that can be used in highly constrained, embedded environments
- Build as both a shared object (.so) and static (.a) library
