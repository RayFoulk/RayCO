# RayTL
A Register-Transfer Level (RTL) circuit simulator framework similar to VHDL or Verilog

# Why?
Mainly because I want to.  I enjoy creating and using my own design tools.
ALso, VHDL and Verilog are both really a superset of what I need to accomplish my goals.

# Status
This purely vaporware at this point.
I need to lay out the design goals and formulate some hard requirements.
In my head, the conceptual design has flip-flopped between using C99 or C++
I still ultimately know which way I'll go, but for now this repo
is serving (temporarly) as a placeholder for some utility code that I had planned to make use of in the project.
